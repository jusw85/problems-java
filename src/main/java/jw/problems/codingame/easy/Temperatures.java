 *
 * The Goal
 *
 * In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.
 * Sample temperatures
 * Here, -1 is the closest to 0.
 * Rules
 * Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
 * Game Input
 * Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.
 * Input
 *
 * Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze
 *
 * Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526
 * Output
 * Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
 * Constraints
 * 0 â‰¤ N < 10000
