 *
 * The Goal
 * Destroy the mountains before your starship collides with one of them. For that, shoot the highest mountain on your path.
 * Rules
 * At the start of each game turn, you are given the height of the 8 mountains from left to right.
 * By the end of the game turn, you must fire on the highest mountain by outputting its index (from 0 to 7).
 *
 * Firing on a mountain will only destroy part of it, reducing its height. Your ship descends after each pass.
 *
 * Victory Conditions
 * You win if you destroy every mountain
 *
 * Lose Conditions
 *
 * Your ship crashes into a mountain
 * You provide incorrect output or your program times out
 *
 * Note
 * Don’t forget to run the tests by launching them from the “Test cases” window. The tests provided and the validators used to calculate your score are slightly different to avoid hard-coded solutions.
 * Game Input
 * Within an infinite loop, read the heights of the mountains from the standard input and print to the standard output the index of the mountain to shoot.
 * Input for one game turn
 * 8 lines: one integer mountainH per line. Each represents the height of one mountain given in the order of their index (from 0 to 7).
 * Output for one game turn
 * A single line with one integer for the index of which mountain to shoot.
 * Constraints
 * 0 ≤ mountainH ≤ 9
 * Response time per turn ≤ 100ms
